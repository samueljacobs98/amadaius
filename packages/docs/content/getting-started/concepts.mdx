## Prompt structure vs. content

- **Prompt structure**: How the content of the prompt is laid out, defined using a Handlebars template string.
- **Prompt content**: The validated and enriched data provided to the template to populate the structure.

## Validation and enrichment with Zod

- **Validation**: Ensures the data adheres to the expected shape and constraints.
- **Enrichment**: Transforms or adds data using Zod's `transform` method.

## Handlebars helpers

Custom functions injected into templates to add dynamic behavior.

## Separation of concerns

Amadaius emphasizes keeping **content** (data) and **structure** (template) independent, enabling easier reuse and localization.

## Modular template composition

Use the `asSchema` method to compose smaller prompt templates into larger, more complex templates, promoting modularity and reusability.
