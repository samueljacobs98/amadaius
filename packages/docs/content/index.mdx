[Amadaius](https://github.com/samueljacobs98/amadaius) is a TypeScript/JavaScript library designed to simplify the process of creating text-based prompts for AI applications. By separating **data validation and transformation** from **prompt structure**, Amadaius keeps your prompts robust, reusable, and easy to manage.

Amadaius is built on familiar tools:

- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for data validation and transformations.
- [Handlebars](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/) for templating.
- Optional custom helpers that can be easily plugged in.

> **TL;DR**
> Amadaius lets you build validated, enriched, and dynamically generated prompts with minimal effort.
