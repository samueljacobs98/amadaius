- **Zod validation**: Ensure your template data is correct.
- **Handlebars-based templating**: Use Handlebars features like conditionals, loops, helpers, and comments.
- **Partial prompt templates**: Build complex prompts incrementally, adding or overriding data fields at each step.
- **Asynchronous support**: Seamlessly handle asynchronous data transformations with `buildAsync(data)`.
- **Modular composition**: Combine smaller prompt templates into larger ones using `asSchema()`.
